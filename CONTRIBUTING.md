<details>

<summary>Add changeset to pull request</code></summary>

1. To record how a pull request affects packages, you will want to add a changeset.

    The changeset provides a summary of the code change. It also describes how package versions should be updated (major, minor, or patch) as a result of the code change.

    ```sh
    # From the workspace root
    pnpm changeset
    ```

</details>


<details>

<summary>Publish packages (for admins)</summary>

1. Generate a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/) in GitHub, with `repo` and `read:user` scopes enabled.

1. Run the `release:changelog` script. This removes changesets, updates the package versions, and updates the `CHANGELOG`'s.

    ```sh
    # From the workspace root
    GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN> pnpm release:changelog
    ```

    The `release:changelog` script also updated the workspace root's version (by following the highest version formula). We will use it to name the tag that will be published.

    ```
    # Highest version formula
    workspace root version = max(
      max(all package versions),
      workspace root version + 0.0.1,
    );
    ```

1. [Create a tag](https://github.com/ijlee2/embroider-toolbox/releases/new) and provide release notes. The tag name should match the workspace root's version.

1. Publish the packages.

    ```sh
    # From the workspace root
    pnpm release:publish
    ```
